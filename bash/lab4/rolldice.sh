### User input validation
# get a valid roll count from the user
until [ $count -gt 0 ]; do
  read -p "How many dice shall I roll? " count
done
# get a valid side count from the user
until [ $sides -gt 3 -a $sides -lt 21 ]; do
  read -p "How many sides should each die have[4-20]? " sides
done

### Main
# do the dice roll as many times as the user asked for
for (( rolls=0 ; rolls < count ; rolls++ )); do
# roll the dice
  die1=$(($RANDOM % $sides +1))
# show the roll results
  echo "Rolled $die1"
done
